# ECE-451/556 Parallel and Distributed Computing
* 2023 Fall
* **Instructor:**  [Dov Kruger](https://RU-ECE/DovKrugerCourses/DovKrugerBio.md)
* **[Meeting Times and Office hours](https://bit.ly/3ObwKEr)
* **[Resources](https:github.com//RU-ece/DovKrugerCourses/DovKrugerBio.md)**
* **[Course Web Address](https://github.com/RU-ECE/ECE569-DB)**
** Prerequisites**
  * Required basic C++, Java, Python, Rust, ??? in order to write clients to DB
    * Your code is your business. If you use python or any language I don't know well, I can't help much

## Hardware Requirements

* A laptop running windows, Mac or Linux. You may use lab machines if necessary
  * Please see me if you cannot afford a laptop. There are a limited set of laptops that perhaps you can be lent
* You must install MariaDB or Mysql. PostGRES is optional, but the more you do, the more you will learn.
* You can install the database in a docker container, in a virtual machine, or on your bare computer. Learning all these things are valuable but not required.

## COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course covers databases

* The goal of databases
* ACID properties
* Database and schema design
* Schema normalization and integrity constraints
* Indices
* Query processing
* Query optimization and cost estimation
* Transactions
* Stored Procedures
* Recovery
* Concurrency control
* Isolation and consistency; 
* Canonical forms
* SQL commands
* Weaknesses of the SQL standard
* Query Optimization
* Data interchange languages: XML, JSON, YAML
* Binary data interchange
* NoSQL databases (MongoDB)
* Scientific structured data ([NetCDF](https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-c/current/), [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/))

## Course Outcomes

After completion of this course, students will be able to
*  Design databases with efficient structure and guaranteed consistency
*  Write queries with transactional integrity
*  Use data interchange standards to import and export data
*  Understand the performance issues of ASCII data transport
*  Identify APIs for binary data transport
*  Use scientific databases to store and retrieve multidimensional data at high speed. 
*  Use a programming language to interact with an SQL database
*  
*  Implement a complete database project
  
## FORMAT AND STRUCTURE
* Classes include slides and live coding. You are encouraged to actively participate.
* There will be paper exercises to be collected, primarily to record attendance. A small number of points will be affected, but 
* Classes will be recorded and the recordings made public each class. You are expected to attend.
